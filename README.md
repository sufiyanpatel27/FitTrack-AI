# 🏋️‍♂️ FitTrackAI (AI-Powered Exercise Form Correction Web Application)

#### Demo: https://fittrackai.vercel.app/

I developed an AI-powered web application that analyzes live video feeds of users performing exercises to detect and correct their form in real-time. By leveraging machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computer vision technologies, the app identifies key body points (such as elbows, wrists, and shoulders) and tracks movements to provide personalized feedback. It detects errors in exercise form, helping users improve their technique. Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and TensorFlow.js, this solution ensures accurate and seamless performance tracking, even in live environments.

## 📖 Project Description

This project is a cutting-edge AI-based web app designed to track, analyze, and correct a user’s exercise form in real-time using live video feeds. By combining the power of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and data science with computer vision, the app effectively detects a user’s skeletal data points (e.g., elbows, wrists, shoulders) and uses these points to assess their movement patterns during workouts.
